HackFortress-Defcon19
=====================

These are the  binary analysis challenges for Hack Fortress at Defcon 19.
I know they are being uploaded a couple of years late, but I just found
them again :P

Since the ShmooCon 2011 Hack Fortress challenges were all written for Linux, 
I thought we'd mix things up and write Defcon's challenges for Windows.

A common complaint for the ShmooCon challenges was that they were too
challenging for the allotted time, and they were valid complaints. So these
challenges are a bit easier, and doubly so since most contestants had access
to more tools that reverse engineers are familiar with, like
OllyDBG and WinDBG, in addition to IDA.

The eight challenges were written in C using Microsoft Visual Studio, and were
intended to become more difficult each bracket. The "Answers" file contains the 
hints that could have been provided to the contestants during the course of the 
competition. Additionally, it contains the solutions to the challenges that
the contestants would have had to submit to indicate successful completion of 
the challenges. For best results, don't peek at the answers until you've had
a go at cracking the binaries :)

Have fun!
